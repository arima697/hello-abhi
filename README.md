My hello abhi repository
I am Abhimannyu Rimal. I am married to Samita Kafle. I have 3 siblings, my dad and step-mom in our family.  
I was born in Nepal and later moved to the United States for my bachelors degree in biochemistry.
Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D in biochemistry at Thomas Jefferson University studying atypical mechanism of MAPK activaiton.
I am learning bioinformatics in my free time.
Today, I opened a github account. I am planning to use github to start organizing the projects and tools I have learnt over the last few years.
I will add more information about my bio later.
